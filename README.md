# Qiling Framework

Qiling is an advanced binary emulation framework that allows you to emulate and sandbox code in an isolated environment across multiple platforms and architectures. Built on top of Unicorn Engine, Qiling provides a higher-level framework that understands operating system contexts, executable formats, and dynamic linking.

For more details on Qiling's use cases, blog posts, and related work, please refer to [Qiling's use case, blog and related work](https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling/issues/134).

## Quick Start

### Installation

Qiling requires Python 3.8 or newer. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install qiling
```

For more detailed installation instructions and dependencies, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling/wiki/Installation).

### Basic Usage

The example below shows how to use Qiling framework in the most straightforward way to emulate a Windows executable.

```python
from qiling import Qiling

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # initialize Qiling instance, specifying the executable to emulate and the emulated system root.
    # note that the current working directory is assumed to be Qiling home
    ql = Qiling([r'examples/rootfs/x86_windows/bin/x86_hello.exe'], r'examples/rootfs/x86_windows')

    # start emulation
    ql.run()
```

## Qiling vs. Other Emulators

There are many open-source emulators, but two projects closest to Qiling are [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org) & [QEMU user mode](https://qemu.org). This section explains the main differences of Qiling against them.

### Qiling vs. Unicorn Engine

Built on top of Unicorn, but Qiling & Unicorn are two different animals.

- **Unicorn** is just a CPU emulator, so it focuses on emulating CPU instructions, that can understand emulator memory. Beyond that, Unicorn is not aware of higher level concepts, such as dynamic libraries, system calls, I/O handling or executable formats like PE, Mach-O or ELF. As a result, Unicorn can only emulate raw machine instructions, without Operating System (OS) context.
- **Qiling** is designed as a higher level framework, that leverages Unicorn to emulate CPU instructions, but can understand OS: it has executable format loaders (for PE, Mach-O & ELF currently), dynamic linkers (so we can load & relocate shared libraries), syscall & IO handlers. For this reason, Qiling can run executable binary without requiring its native OS.

### Qiling vs. QEMU User Mode

QEMU user mode does a similar thing to our emulator, that is, to emulate whole executable binaries in a cross-architecture way.
However, Qiling offers some important differences against QEMU user mode:

- **Qiling is a true analysis framework**, that allows you to build your own dynamic analysis tools on top (in Python). Meanwhile, QEMU is just a tool, not a framework.
- **Qiling can perform dynamic instrumentation**, and can even hot patch code at runtime. QEMU does neither.
- Not only working cross-architecture, **Qiling is also cross-platform**. For example, you can run Linux ELF file on top of Windows. In contrast, QEMU user mode only runs binary of the same OS, such as Linux ELF on Linux, due to the way it forwards syscall from emulated code to native OS.
- **Qiling supports more platforms**, including Windows, macOS, Linux & BSD. QEMU user mode can only handle Linux & BSD.

## Examples

- The following example shows how a Windows crackme may be patched dynamically to make it always display the “Congratulation” dialog.

```python
from qiling import Qiling

def force_call_dialog_func(ql: Qiling):
    # get DialogFunc address from current stack frame
    lpDialogFunc = ql.stack_read(-8)

    # setup stack memory for DialogFunc
    ql.stack_push(0)
    ql.stack_push(1001)     # IDS_APPNAME
    ql.stack_push(0x111)    # WM_COMMAND
    ql.stack_push(0)

    # push return address
    ql.stack_push(0x0401018)

    # resume emulation from DialogFunc address
    ql.arch.regs.eip = lpDialogFunc


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # initialize Qiling instance
    ql = Qiling([r'rootfs/x86_windows/bin/Easy_CrackMe.exe'], r'rootfs/x86_windows')

    # NOP out some code
    ql.patch(0x004010B5, b'\x90\x90')
    ql.patch(0x004010CD, b'\x90\x90')
    ql.patch(0x0040110B, b'\x90\x90')
    ql.patch(0x00401112, b'\x90\x90')

    # hook at an address with a callback
    ql.hook_address(force_call_dialog_func, 0x00401016)
    ql.run()
```

The below YouTube video shows how the above example works.

#### Emulating ARM router firmware on Ubuntu x64 host

Qiling Framework hot-patches and emulates an ARM router's `/usr/bin/httpd` on an x86_64 Ubuntu host.

#### Emulating MBR

## Qltool

Qiling also provides a friendly tool named `qltool` to quickly emulate shellcode & executable binaries.

With qltool, easy execution can be performed:

With shellcode:

```bash
$ ./qltool code --os linux --arch arm --format hex -f examples/shellcodes/linarm32_tcp_reverse_shell.hex
```

With binary file:

```bash
$ ./qltool run -f examples/rootfs/x8664_linux/bin/x8664_hello --rootfs  examples/rootfs/x8664_linux/
```

With binary and GDB debugger enabled:

```bash
$ ./qltool run -f examples/rootfs/x8664_linux/bin/x8664_hello --gdb 127.0.0.1:9999 --rootfs examples/rootfs/x8664_linux
```

With code coverage collection (UEFI only for now):

```bash
$ ./qltool run -f examples/rootfs/x8664_efi/bin/TcgPlatformSetupPolicy --rootfs examples/rootfs/x8664_efi --coverage-format drcov --coverage-file TcgPlatformSetupPolicy.cov
```

With JSON output (Windows, mainly):

```bash
$ ./qltool run -f examples/rootfs/x86_windows/bin/x86_hello.exe --rootfs  examples/rootfs/x86_windows/ --console False --json
```
